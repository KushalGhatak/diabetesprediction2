The Diabetes Prediction Project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes based on various health metrics. By analyzing patient data, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and other relevant factors, we can create a predictive model that helps identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes. This project will not only provide insights into the key factors contributing to diabetes but also aid in early detection and prevention efforts.
